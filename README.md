# AI-Powered Text Summarizer Web App

Welcome to the Project Based Learning module on building an AI-powered text summarizer web app! In this module, you will be guided through the process of creating a powerful and user-friendly text summarization application using various technologies including Node.js, Replit, the Hugging Face Inference API, and Postman.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a web application that allows users to input text and receive a summarized version generated by AI. 

- Building and deploying a full-stack app on Replit using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Node.js.
- Exploring real-world APIs with Postman, including the Hugging Face Inference API for text summarization.
- Using Postman to generate code and integrate APIs into an application.

## Tools and Technologies

### API Platform

- **Postman**: A platform for exploring and testing APIs, which will be used to interact with the Hugging Face Inference API.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment used for building the backend of the application.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js, which will be used to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Hugging Face Inference API**: An API for natural language processing tasks, particularly text summarization in this case.

### Frontend

- **HTML**: Hypertext Markup Language for structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets for styling the web page.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for adding interactivity to the web page.
